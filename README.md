# To-Do List

A simple, interactive to-do list web application that allows users to add, edit, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are stored in `localStorage`, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Click the "EDIT" button next to a task to modify its content.
- **Mark as Completed**: Click the "DONE" button to mark a task as completed.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are stored in `localStorage` so they remain even after a page refresh.
- **Stylish UI**: A clean and minimalistic design with smooth interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality, event handling, and `localStorage` management.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button.
3. Edit tasks by clicking "EDIT" and modifying the text.
4. Mark tasks as completed by clicking "DONE."
5. Completed tasks disappear from the list.
